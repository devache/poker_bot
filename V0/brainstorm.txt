Testing reenforcment learning with a poker AI (texas holdem)

input features for bot (sorted by importance):
 - win probability |
 - win variance    |->MC simulation
 - how much money is to win / to lose
 - which round
 - individual oponents current bet
 - betting history
 - basic memory/feedback scheme (for adapting strategy)
 - random componant (hiding deterministic strategy)

main algorithms:
 - Q-learning applied to
	- linear regression
	- NNs (DQN)
	- 
 - evolutionary algorithm (Neuro-evolution)


Timeline:
 - setup project structure and libraries
 - setup mlflow instance?
 - create features
 - first model implementation
